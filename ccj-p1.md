#Crispy Crunchy JavaScript

Crispy Crunchy JavaScript is a series of blog posts designed to help Javascript programmers to transition from basic to advance level

####Assumptions: 
1. Reader are expected to have some experience in programming with JavaScript. 
2. They are expected to be aware of general JavaScript syntax and basic HTML DOM manipulation.



##Part-1:Interpreted and ObjectÂ based

###It is interpreted

Unlike C and Java, JavaScript is interpreted language. It is also categorised as a scripting language. In case of C and Java, source code is read and compiled to either a CPU understandable format or a CPU friendly intermediary format. Both format are not intended to be friendly to the human readers. The result of successful compilation is be stored in a file to be fed to CPU to get the output of the original C or Java source code.

Major benefit of the compilation are:
1. The capture of many language syntax errors in the original source code.
3. Compilation also performs many language dependent optimization to improved reliability and efficiency of the original source code.  
2. CPU friendly format makes program run faster.


JavaScript, being scripted or interpreted language doesn't have a manual compilation step. the source code is directly fed to an interpreter or execution engine that reads it line by line, converts it into CPU instruction and run it immediately on the CPU without any manual intervention. In case of any error it stops the interpretation and execution of further code.

All browsers have built-in JavaScript interpreters. When an HTML source is parsed by browser window, any JavaScript code or file in script tag is fed to JavaScript engine and immediately executed. 

We also have standalone JavaScript engine of interpreters like nodejs. They can run JavaScript file directly without it being loaded through a browser.

Pros of being interpreted language.
1. faster development: Since there is no compilation step involved, modified code change is directly executed and tested. It save time and hassle of compilation. 
2. It allows programmers to embed human readable source code directly into the html or similar places. It results easier management of entire source code. Imagine how hard it would be to understand and management of different versions of non-friendly compiled code in the middle of html file.

Both benefits lead to faster turnaround of programs. It is a major factor in rapid business development.

Cons of being interpreted language.
1. Since there is no compilation, programmers have tremendous responsibility to supply error free code to the production application environments. Nowadays, IDEs like Rubymine are very effective in catching possible syntax errors and bugs at the time of source code writing itself.

2. Interpreted code executes slower than the compiled code, because of its conversion to a machine understandable format at the time of execution itself. But with modern CPUs and kind of programs where JavaScript is used, impact on user experience is negligible.



It is Object based.

Unlike C or other procedural language, every variable value in JavaScript is an object. For example,

	var a = 10;    
	var b = 3.14;  
	var C = 'I am an Indian';
	var d = ['foo', 'bar'];

	console.log('in js1. a.constructor.name : ' + a.constructor.name);
	console.log('in js1. b.constructor.name : ' + b.constructor.name);
	console.log('in js1. C.constructor.name : ' + C.constructor.name);
	console.log('in js1. d.constructor.name : ' + d.constructor.name);

	Result:
	/*
	in js1. a.constructor.name : Number
	in js1. b.constructor.name : Number
	in js1. C.constructor.name : String
	in js1. d.constructor.name : Array
	 */

Unlike Java, JavaScript before 2015 version does not implement some of the standard features of Object Oriented Programming like encapsulation, inheritance. We can achieve them programmatically using prototypical inheritance and clever programming.  
	 
Though in ECMAscript 2015(Standard for JavaScript) has introduced classes with features like encapsulation and inheritance, but they are syntactical sugar over existing prototypical based inheritance.

	JavaScript objects are more like key value pairs. They can follow a predefined structure (of key value pairs), but their structure can be altered at any point of time. Any key can be added to or deleted from a pre constructed object as shown in following examples. Any such change doesn't alter the type name retrieved by way of typeof or constructor.name operations.

	var obj = {};

console.log('in js1. typeof obj : ' + typeof obj);

obj.prop1 = 10;
obj['prop2'] = 'See that how one can modify an object';

console.log('in js1. obj ' + JSON.stringify(obj));
console.log('in js1. typeof obj : ' + typeof obj);

delete  obj.prop1;
console.log('in js1. obj ' + JSON.stringify(obj));

/*
 in js1. typeof obj : object
 in js1. obj {"prop1":10,"prop2":"See that how one can modify an object"}
 in js1. typeof obj : object
 in js1. obj {"prop2":"See that how one can modify an object"}
 */	

It is weak type language.

Unlike C and Java, variable do no have type associated with them. In other words variable type is also varies. For example: 

    var a; // variable declaration

    a = 10;  // Number value assignment
    console.log('in js1. a.constructor.name : ' + a.constructor.name);

    a = 'I am an Indian';  // String value assignment
    console.log('in js1. a.constructor.name : ' + a.constructor.name);

	Result:
    /*
       in js1. a.constructor.name : Number
       in js1. a.constructor.name : String
     */
   Type of the variable can only be inferred by its type. It means programmer needs to be absolutely sure about the possible value/s of the variable at runtime, before calling any methods or operators on it. Since there is no compilation, any oversight will only be detected during program execution. To create large reliable programs in JavaScript, it is absolute essential that all test cases are covered in the test plan and all of them are thoroughly executed even for small modification of the source code.
   
 Part 3

 Global variable, definition bubbling, local variable
   
   
   Global variable
   
   In any JavaScript file, any variable declared with or without var keyword outside of any function scope is global variable. Every global variable is accessible from any where in the code. If current JavaScript is loaded into a browser window, all global variables and global functions become properties of window object (DOM window object), for example:
   
   
	a = 20;   // global variable
	var b = 'i love JavaScript'; // another global variable

	function globalFunction() {
		console.log('in js1.globalFunction a : ' + a);
		console.log('in js1.globalFunction b : ' + b);

		// a and b are now actually properties of dom window object
		console.log('in js1.globalFunction window.a : ' + window.a);
		console.log('in js1.globalFunction window.b : ' + window.b);
	}

	globalFunction();
    console.log('in js1. window.globalFunction.toSource()) : ' + window.globalFunction.toSource());
   
   /*
	in js1.globalFunction a : 20 
	in js1.globalFunction b : i love JavaScript 
	in js1.globalFunction window.a : 20 
	in js1.globalFunction window.b : i love JavaScript 
	
	18:24:50.148 in js1. window.globalFunction.toSource() : function globalFunction() {
		console.log('in js1.globalFunction a : ' + a);
		console.log('in js1.globalFunction b : ' + b);

		console.log('in js1.globalFunction window.a : ' + window.a);
		console.log('in js1.globalFunction window.b : ' + window.b);
	}
	*/
   
   Local variable definition bubbling:
   
   When a variable is declared using var keyword anywhere within a function scope except within a function expression, that declaration is automatically treated as if declared at the start of the function source code. Such variable remains local within the function, for example:
   
   
   function fact(n) {

		console.log('in js1.fact res : ' + res); // no error here as "var res;" becomes the first statement of the function
		if (n < 0) {
			return NaN;
		} else {
			var res = 1;  // value of res is assigned at this location
		}

		while (n > 1) {
			res = res * n;
			n = n - 1;
		}
		console.log('in js1.fact res : ' + res);
		return res;
	}


	fact(10);
	console.log('in js1. res : ' + res);  // res is scoped only within function "fact".
	
	/*
	in js1.fact res : undefined
	in js1.fact res : 3628800
	ReferenceError: res is not defined
	 */
   
   Block scoped local variable

   When a variable is declared with "let" keyword, it remains valid only in the defining and child scopes, for example:
   function evening_routine(status) {
		if (status === 'married') {
			let evening_steps =['look at the bed', 'go to the fridge'];
		} else {
			let evening_steps =['look into the fridge', 'go to the bed'];
		}
		console.log('in js1.f evening_steps : ' + evening_steps);
	}

	evening_routine();

	/*
	 ReferenceError: evening_steps is not defined
	 */
	in this example both 'evening_steps' variable are defined and assigned within separate code blocks. Outside of their defining block they do not exist.
	
   
   Automatic Global variable
   
    If a variable is directly assigned without var or let keyword, it is automatically added to the global scope, for Example:  
   
	function evening_routine(status) {

		if (status === 'married') {
			evening_steps =['look at the bed', 'go to the fridge'];
		} else {
			evening_steps =['look into the fridge', 'go to the bed'];
		}

		console.log('in js1.evening_routine evening_steps : ' + evening_steps);
	}

	evening_routine('married');
	console.log('out of js1.evening_routine evening_steps :' + evening_steps);
   
	/*
	in js1.evening_routine evening_steps : look at the bed,go to the fridge
	out of js1.evening_routine evening_steps :look at the bed,go to the fridge
	*/
